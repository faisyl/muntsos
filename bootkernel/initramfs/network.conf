# Static network configuration, common to all interfaces:
# These can all be overridden by DHCP!

#gateway=1.2.3.1
#domain=foo.com
#nameservers="2.3.4.5 3.4.5.6 4.5.6.7"

# Static network configuration, specific to a single interface:
# Any interface not configured here will automatically use DHCP!

#eth0_address=1.2.3.4
#eth0_netmask=255.255.255.0

# Some network devices don't have permanent Ethernet MAC addresses.
# You can assign a locally unique Ethernet MAC address like this:

#eth0_macaddr=02:00:00:00:00:01
#eth0_address=dhcp

# USB Network Gadget configuration

#usb0_address=10.254.254.252
#usb0_netmask=255.255.255.248
#usb0_peer=10.254.254.253
