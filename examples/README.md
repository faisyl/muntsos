Embedded Linux Example Programs
===============================

Here are some example programs for embedded Linux systems. They are
primarily written for the cross-compiled [MuntsOS Embedded Linux
Framework](http://git.munts.com/muntsos), but they can also be built
with native compilers for conventional Linux distributions such as
Debian.

Most of these example programs depend on
[**libsimpleio**](http://git.munts.com/libsimpleio), the Linux Simple
I/O Library.

Questions or comments to Philip Munts <phil@munts.net>

I am available for custom system development (hardware and software) of
products based on embedded Linux microcomputers or other processors.
