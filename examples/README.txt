                        Embedded Linux Example Programs

   Here are some example programs for embedded Linux systems. They are
   primarily written for the cross-compiled [1]MuntsOS Embedded Linux
   Framework, but they can also be built with native compilers for
   conventional Linux distributions such as Debian.

   Most of these example programs depend on [2]libsimpleio, the Linux
   Simple I/O Library.
