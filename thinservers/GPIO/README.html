<h1>Dedicated GPIO Server using MuntsOS</h1>
<p><a href="http://git.munts.com/muntsos">MuntsOS</a> is a very small
embedded Linux distribution based on <a href=
"http://www.busybox.net">BusyBox</a> and other components. MuntsOS is delivered
as a single Linux kernel image file, which also contains the root file system
using the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initramfs"><tt>initramfs</tt></a> facility. After
the Linux kernel has booted, the system runs entirely from RAM. There are
several advantages to this, especially for remote and/or headless embedded
systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot time is significantly faster</li>
<li>File system access is very fast</li>
<li>Risk of SD card corruption is minimized</li>
<li>No need to perform an orderly shutdown</li>
</ul>
<p>At boot time the MuntsOS environment can be extended by packages in
<tt>/boot/packages</tt> or <i>extension modules</i> which are executable shell
archive scripts installed in the directory <tt>autoexec.d</tt> on various media
such as the SD card boot partition, USB mass storage device, USB CD-ROM, or NFS
mount.</p>
<p>This <tt>Makefile</tt> builds a <tt>.zip</tt> file containing everything
needed to boot MuntsOS running the <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/extensions/GPIO">GPIO Server</a>
Extension.</p>
<p>Just download one of the GPIO Thin Server zip files from <a href=
"http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/thinservers">http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/thinservers</a>
and extract it to a freshly formatted FAT32 SD card, and insert it into the
target system. You can then modify <tt>autoexec.d/00-wlan-init</tt> on the SD
card to customize it for your wireless network environment, if desired.</p>
