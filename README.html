<h1>MuntsOS Embedded Linux</h1>
<p>This framework supports Linux on several single board microcomputers. The
goal of the MuntsOS project is to deliver a turnkey, RAM resident Linux
operating system for very low cost single board microcomputers. With MuntsOS
installed, such microcomputers can treated as components, as <i>Linux
microcontrollers</i>, and integrated into other projects just like traditional
single chip microcontrollers.</p>
<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
<li>24 August 2022 -- Migrated Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 4 to Linux kernel 5.15.x.
Migrating to 5.15.x has proved to be a grueling exercise, easily the most
difficult kernel migration in the history of MuntsOS Embedded Linux. Linux
kernel 5.15.x still doesn't work right on Raspberry Pi 1 boards, so they are
still frozen at kernel 5.10.95 for the moment.</li>
<li>29 August 2022 -- Refreshed all toolchain packages, kernels, and
extensions. Toolchains for the BeagleBone and Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 have been
built with Crosstool-NG release 1.25.0, providing GCC 10.3.0. GCC 10.3.0 causes
problems for the now obsolete Raspberry Pi 1 so its toolchain was built with
Crosstoo-NG release 1.24.0, providing GCC 8.3.0. The Raspberry Pi 1 kernel has
now been advanced to 5.15.61, as with the Raspberry Pi 2/3/4. MuntsOS for the
ARMv6 Raspberry Pi 1 is now in maintenance mode. I will keep supporting the
Raspberry Pi 1 for as long as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Embedded Linux Distribution in a Kernel</h2>
<p>MuntsOS is a stripped down Linux distribution that includes a small
compressed root file system within the kernel image binary itself. At boot time
the root file system is unpacked into RAM and thereafter the system runs
entirely in RAM.</p>
<p>Each kernel release tarball contains a kernel image file
(<b><tt>.img</tt></b>), which may be common to several different microcomputer
boards, and one or more <a href=
"http://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference">device tree</a> files
(<b><tt>.dtb</tt></b>) that are specific to particular microcomputer boards.
Some kernel release tarballs also contain one or more device tree overlay files
(<b><tt>.dtbo</tt></b>) that can make small changes to the device tree at boot
time.</p>
<p>Prebuilt MuntsOS kernel release tarballs are available at:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/kernels">http://repo.munts.com/muntsos/kernels</a></p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>The MuntsOS root file system can be <i>extended</i> at boot time using any
of three mechanisms:</p>
<p>First, if <b><tt>/boot/tarballs</tt></b> exists, any <b><tt>gzip</tt></b>
tarball files (<b><tt>.tgz</tt></b>) in it will be extracted on top of the root
file system. Typically you would use this mechanism for customized
<b><tt>/etc/passwd</tt></b>, <b><tt>.ssh/authorized_keys</tt></b>, and similiar
system configuration files.</p>
<p>Second, if <b><tt>/boot/packages/${BOARDBASE}</tt></b> exists, any Debian
package files (<b><tt>.deb</tt></b>) in it will be installed into the root file
system. Note that packages from the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>
project will probably not work with MuntsOS. Packages should be built
specifically for MuntsOS. (The <b><tt>.deb</tt></b> package file format is
simply convenient to use, as it is supported by BusyBox.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://git.munts.com/muntsos/extensions/GPIO">GPIO Server</a>
extension package demonstrates how to build a Debian package that adds
application specific software to MuntsOS.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the system startup script <b><tt>/etc/rc</tt></b> can be configured
via a kernel command line option to search for a subdirectory called
<b><tt>autoexec.d</tt></b> in various places, such as SD card, USB flash drive,
USB CD-ROM or NFS mount. If an <b><tt>autoexec.d</tt></b> subdirectory is
found, each executable program or script in it will be executed when the system
boots.</p>
<p>The idea is to build a MuntsOS kernel (which takes a long time) once and
install it to the target platform. Then application specific software can be
built after the fact and installed as one or more tarball files in
<b><tt>/boot/tarballs</tt></b>, Debian package files in
<b><tt>/boot/packages/${BOARDBASE}</tt></b>, or extension programs in
<b><tt>/boot/autoexec.d</tt></b>.</p>
<p>Prebuilt MuntsOS extension packages and programs are available at:</p>

<h2>Thin Servers</h2>
<h3>Boot Files + Kernel Files + Extensions = Thin Server</h3>
<p>The <i>Thin Server</i> is a system design pattern that is little more than a
network interface for a single I/O device. Ideally, a Thin Server will be built
from a cheap and ubiquitous network microcomputer like the Raspberry Pi. The
software must be easy to install from a user's PC or Mac without requiring any
special programming tools. It must be able to run headless, administered via
the network. It must be able to survive without orderly shutdowns, and must not
write much to flash media. It must provide a network based API (Application
Programming Interface) using HTTP as a lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>MuntsOS, with its operating system running entirely from RAM, serves well
for the Thin Server, and the two concepts have evolved together over the past
few years. The simplest way to use MuntsOS is to download one of the prebuilt
Thin Server <b><tt>.zip</tt></b> files and extract it to a freshly formatted
FAT32 SD card. You can then modify <b><tt>autoexec.d/00-wlan-init</tt></b> on
the SD card to pre-configure it for your wireless network environment, if
desired, before inserting it in the target board. After booting MuntsOS, log in
from the console or via SSH (user "<b><tt>root</tt></b>", password
"<b><tt>default</tt></b>") and run <b><tt>sysconfig</tt></b> to perform more
system configuration.</p>
<p><i>Note: BeagleBone boards require the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_flag">boot flag</a> to be set on the FAT32
boot partition on the SD card or on-board eMMC. The ROM boot loader in the CPU
will ignore any partitions that are not marked as bootable.</i></p>

<h2>Boards</h2>
<h3>BeagleBone</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://beagleboard.org/bone-original">BeagleBone</a> was one of
the first low cost Linux microcomputers. It originally sold for USD $89 at its
launch in October 2011.</p>
<p>The BeagleBone has a Texas Instruments <a href=
"http://www.ti.com/product/AM3359">Sitara AM3359</a> processor running at 720
MHz and 256 MB of RAM. It has two USB port sockets: One type A host port and
one type mini-B device port. Unlike any of its successors, the original
BeagleBone has its USB device port connected to a USB hub instead of directly
to the AM3359. Three distinct USB devices are visible to the host on the device
port socket: The AM3359 device port, a USB JTAG device, and a USB serial port
device connected to the AM3359 console serial port. The BeagleBone also has two
<a href="http://beagleboard.org/pru">PRU</a> (Programmable Realtime Unit) I/O
processors on board that are capable of very fast I/O operations.</p>
<p>MuntsOS includes device tree overlays than can be enabled by
<b><tt>sysconfig</tt></b> that allow configuring any of the expansion header
GPIO pins with <b><tt>config-pin</tt></b>. The system startup script
<b><tt>/etc/rc</tt></b> will initialize GPIO pin modes according to
<b><tt>/etc/pinmux.conf</tt></b>. By default, the following devices are are
enabled on the two 46-pin <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/BeagleBonePinout.pdf">expansion
headers</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I<sup>2</sup>C bus controller device <b><tt>/dev/i2c-2</tt></b></li>
<li>Serial port device <b><tt>/dev/ttyS1</tt></b></li>
<li>Serial port device <b><tt>/dev/ttyS2</tt></b></li>
<li>Serial port device <b><tt>/dev/ttyS4</tt></b></li>
<li>Serial port device <b><tt>/dev/ttyS5</tt></b></li>
<li>SPI slave device <b><tt>/dev/spidev2.0</tt></b></li>
<li>SPI slave device <b><tt>/dev/spidev2.1</tt></b></li>
</ul>
<p>Newly manufactured BeagleBone boards assembled with a 1 GHz AM3358 processor
are apparently still available from <a href=
"https://specialcomp.com/beagleboard/bone.htm">Special Computing</a>.</p>
<h3>BeagleBone Black</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://beagleboard.org/black">BeagleBone Black</a> is a cost
reduced version of the BeagleBone. It currently sells for about USD $55. The
BeagleBone Black originally sold for USD $45 at its launch in April 2013, which
would have been an impressive feat except that the Raspberry Pi had already
arrived on the market a few months earlier at USD $35. Although the BeagleBone
Black was more capable thttp://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/han the first couple
of Raspberry Pi generations, it has been overshadowed by the Raspberry Pi Model
2 and 3, which sport quad-core processors. The great strength of the BeagleBone
Black and its kin compared to the Raspberry Pi family is the sheer number of
GPIO pins and peripheral ports available on its two 46-pin <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/BeagleBonePinout.pdf">expansion headers</a>.
Even after eMMC, I<sup>2</sup>C, SPI, and UART pins have been allocated, there
are 42 GPIO pins available.</p>
<p>The BeagleBone Black has a Texas Instruments <a href=
"http://www.ti.com/product/AM3358">Sitara AM3358</a> processor running at 1
GHz, 512 MB of RAM and 4 GB eMMC flash on board. It uses the same kernel as the
BeagleBone, with a different device tree.</p>
<p>Unlike the original BeagleBone (above) and the BeagleBone Green (below), the
BeagleBone Black has an HDMI video output (though with a pesky micro HDMI
connecteor). The HDMI interface consumes a large number of GPIO pins when it is
enabled. This MuntsOS port does not enable the HDMI interface.</p>
<h3>BeagleBone Black Wireless</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://beagleboard.org/black-wireless">BeagleBone Black
Wireless</a> is a variant of the BeagleBone Black that has replaced the wired
Ethernet interface with a built-in Wifi radio. It also has replaced the mini-B
slave USB receptacle with a more modern micro-B receptacle. It is otherwise
highly compatible with the BeagleBone Black. It sells for about USD $70,
considerably more than any of the other boards supported by MuntsOS, and also
considerably more than a BeagleBone Green plus a USB WiFi adapter.</p>
<p>The BeagleBone Black Wireless uses the same kernel as the BeagleBone, with a
different device tree.</p>
<p>MuntsOS does not currently support the on-board Bluetooth radio.</p>
<h3>BeagleBone Green</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://beagleboard.org/green">BeagleBone Green</a> is a cost
reduced version of the BeagleBone Black, from Chinese manufacturer <a href=
"https://www.seeedstudio.com">Seeed Studio</a>, that sells for about USD $44.
Changes from the BeagleBone Black design are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed coaxial power jack . (+5V can be supplied via the slave USB port or
<b>P9</b> expansion header instead.)</li>
<li>Removed HDMI receptacle and support circuitry.</li>
<li>Changed the slave USB receptacle from mini-B to micro-B.</li>
<li>Added two <a href="http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove_System">Grove System</a>
connectors, one carrying 3.3V <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2C">I<sup>2</sup>C</a> signals and one carrying
3.3V logic level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial
port</a> signals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BeagleBone Green uses the same kernel as the BeagleBone, with a
different device tree.</p>
<p>The BeagleBone Green http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/is cost competitive
with the Raspberry Pi, costing only a little more but including on board eMMC
and a USB cable. It has only a single core processor, compared to the quad-core
Raspberry Pi 3, but provides many more GPIO pins on its two 46-pin <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/BeagleBonePinout.pdf">expansion headers</a>.
It also has separate dedicated host and slave USB ports as well as the two
Grove sockets.</p>
<p>The BeagleBone Green plus a USB WiFi adapter is about USD $20 cheaper than a
BeagleBone Black Wireless, while retaining the possibility for wired
Ethernet.</p>
<h3>BeagleBone Green Wireless</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://beagleboard.org/green-wireless">BeagleBone Green
Wireless</a> is a variant of the BeagleBone Green that has replaced the wired
Ethernet interface with a built-in Wifi radio. It is otherwise highly
compatible with the BeagleBone Green. It sells for about USD $53.</p>
<p>The BeagleBone Green http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/Wireless uses the same
kernel as the BeagleBone, with a different device tree.</p>
<p>MuntsOS does not currently support the on-board Bluetooth radio.</p>
<p>The BeagleBone Green Wireless is a mixed blessing: It has 4 USB ports and
on-board WiFi, but commandeers quite a few of the expansion header GPIO pins
for the on-board radios. Among other things, this seems to prohibit using
<b><tt>SPI1</tt></b>. Also, the physical layout prevents using the <a href=
"https://www.mikroe.com/beaglebone">BeagleBone Click Shield</a>, which has some
advantages over the newer <a href=
"https://www.mikroe.com/beaglebone-mikrobus-cape">mikroBus Cape</a>.</p>
<h3>PocketBeagle</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://beagleboard.org/pocket">PocketBeagle</a> is a cost and
size reduced version of the BeagleBone Black. It currently sells for about USD
$25 and is intended for the same market niche as the Rasperry Pi Zero. Although
considerably more expensive than either version of the Raspberry Pi Zero, the
PocketBeagle has many more I/O devices directly accessible from its expansion
headers.</p>
<p>The PocketBeagle uses the same kernel as the BeagleBone, with a different
device tree. The PocketBeagle device tree enables the following devices on its
two 36-pin <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/muntsos/doc/PocketBeaglePinout.pdf">expansion
headers</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB host port</li>
<li>I<sup>2</sup>C bus controller device <b><tt>/dev/i2c-1</tt></b></li>
<li>I<sup>2</sup>C bus controller device <b><tt>/dev/i2c-2</tt></b></li>
<li>PWM output <b><tt>0:0</tt></b></li>
<li>PWM output <b><tt>2:0</tt></b></li>
<li>Serial port device <b><tt>/dev/ttyS0</tt></b></li>
<li>Serial port device <b><tt>/dev/ttyS4</tt></b></li>
<li>SPI slave device <b><tt>/dev/spidev1.0</tt></b></li>
<li>SPI slave device <b><tt>/dev/spidev2.1</tt></b></li>
</ul>
<p>The expansion headers are cleverly arranged such that the two inner rows
match the <a href="https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus">MikroElektronika
mikroBUS</a> specification. If female sockets are installed on the top of the
PocketBeagle, two <a href="https://shop.mikroe.com/click">Click Boards</a> can
be plugged directly into the expansion headers.</p>
<p>Like the Raspberry Pi Zero, the PocketBeagle comes without on-board eMMC,
USB cable, micro-SD card, or expansion headers.</p>
<p>Unlike the Raspberry Pi Zero, the PocketBeagle expansion headers do not
match its progenitors, so BeagleBone capes cannot be used on it.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi</a> is a family of low
cost Linux microcomputers selling for USD $5 to $75 (depending on model). There
have been four generations of Raspberry Pi microcomputers, each using a
successively more sophisticated Broadcom ARM core CPU.</p>
<p>Some Raspberry Pi models have an on-board Bluetooth radio that uses the
serial port signals that are brought out to the expansion header. By default,
MuntsOS port disables the on-board Bluetooth radio, in favor of the serial port
on the expansion header.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 1</h4>
<p>Raspberry Pi 1 models have a BCM2708 ARMv6 single-core CPU running at 700 to
1000 MHz and come with with 256 MB to 512 MB of RAM. They have 10/100 Ethernet,
1 to 4 USB ports, HDMI, RCA composite video and a stereo headphone or
three-pole A/V jack. They also have several miniature connectors for camera and
LCD display modules as well as a single 26 or 40 pin 2.54 mm pitch GPIO
expansion connector.</p>
<p>All Raspberry Pi 1 models use the same 32-bit ARMv6 kernel and toolchains,
with different device trees.</p>
<p>With the advent of the <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w">Raspberry Pi Zero
2</a>, all Raspberry Pi 1 models are now obsolete. MuntsOS Embedded Linux will
continue to support all Raspberry Pi 1 models.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 2 and 3</h4>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b">Rasbperry Pi 2
Model B</a> has a 900 MHz BCM2709 ARMv7 Cortex-A7 (900 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8
Cortex-A53 on later production boards) quad-core CPU and comes with 1 GB of
RAM. It is mechanically compatible with the Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+, with
10/100 Ethernet, 4 USB ports, 3.5 mm A/V jack, and a 40-pin GPIO expansion
header.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b">Rasbperry Pi 3
Model B</a> has a 1200 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has 1 GB
of RAM along with on-board Bluetooth and WiFi radios.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus">Raspberry Pi
3 Model A+</a> has the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+, with
only one USB host port and no wired Ethernet. It has a 1400 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8
Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has 512 MB of RAM along with on-board Bluetooth
and WiFi radios.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus">Raspberry Pi
3 Model B+</a> has a 1400 MHz BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad-core CPU and has
improved power management and networking components.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w">Raspberry Pi Zero
2</a> has the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi Zero W, with a 1000 MHz
BCM2710 ARMv8 Cortex-A53 quad core CPU and 512 MB of RAM along with on-board
Bluetooth and WiFi radios.</p>
<p>All Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 models can use the same 32-bit ARMv7 kernel and
toolchains, with different device trees. There are also 64-bit AArch64
toolchains and ARMv8 kernels available for the Raspberry Pi 3, though with 1 GB
or less of RAM there is no particular advantage in running 64-bit.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 4</h4>
<p>The <a href=
"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b">Raspberry Pi 4
Model B</a> has a 1500 MHz BCM2711 ARMv8 Cortex-A72 quad-core CPU and is
available with 1 to 8 GB of RAM. It diverged significantly from the Raspberry
Pi 1 B+ form factor, with the USB and Ethernet ports reversed, two micro-HDMI
connectors instead of a single full size HDMI connector, and a USB-C power
connector instead of micro-USB. Two of the USB ports are 3.0 and two are 2.0. A
major improvement is a Gigabit Ethernet controller connected via PCI Express
instead of the USB connected Ethernet used for all earlier models. The
Raspberry Pi 4 Model B uses the same wireless chip set as the 3+.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi Model 4 B is much more powerful than any previous Raspberry
Pi, and is completely usable as a general purpose desktop computer. It does
require significantly more power and generates significantly more heat. It
supports dual monitors, which is mostly irrelevant for embedded systems. I have
some doubt about the long term physical robustness of the micro-HDMI
connectors.</p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi USB Gadget Kernels</h4>
<p>MuntsOS also provides Raspberry Pi kernels with dedicated <a href=
"http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget">USB Gadget</a> support enabled. These kernels
run on Models 1 A, A+, CM1, Zero, Zero Wireless, 3 A+, CM3, Zero 2, 4 B, and
CM4. You can supply power to and communicate with a compatible Raspberry Pi
solely through the USB port. This kernel supports USB Network, Raw HID, and
Serial Port gadgets, selected by bits in the <b><tt>OPTIONS</tt></b> word
passed on the kernel command line. The USB Gadget Thin Servers have USB Network
Gadget selected by default.</p>
<p>The absolute minimum possible usable Raspberry Pi kit consists of a
Raspberry Pi Zero, Zero W, or Zero 2, a micro-USB cable, and a micro-SD card
with one of the MuntsOS Raspberry Pi USB Gadget Thin Servers installed.</p>
<h2>Cross-Toolchains</h2>
<p>I build a custom Ada/C/C++/Fortran/Go cross-toolchain (using <a href=
"https://crosstool-ng.github.io">Crosstool-NG</a>) for each MuntsOS platform
family. Each cross-toolchain requires a number of additional software component
libraries, which are packaged and distributed separately but installed into the
same directory tree as the parent cross-toolchain.</p>
<p>I also build <a href="https://www.freepascal.org">Free Pascal</a>
cross-compilers. These rely on the libraries in the Ada/C/C++/Fortran/Go
cross-toolchain, which must be installed first.</p>
<p>Sometimes cross-toolchains can be shared among different platforms: For
example, the Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi 3 can use the same
cross-toolchains (the 32-bit ARMv7 cross-toolchains nominally built for the
Raspberry Pi 2), and the Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 4 can also use the
same cross-toolchains (the 64-bit AArch64 cross-toolchains nominally built for
the Raspberry Pi 3).</p>
<p>Cross-toolchain packages built for <a href=
"https://www.debian.org">Debian</a> Linux are available at:</p>
<a href="http://repo.munts.com/debian11">http://repo.munts.com/debian11</a>
<p>Since they are statically linked, it may be possible to use these
cross-toolchain packages on other Linux distributions (possibly with the help
off a conversion utility like <a href=
"https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/rpms/alien"><b><tt>alien</tt></b></a>).</p>
<p>For the convenience of users of Linux distributions other than Debian,
snapshot toolchain tarballs for each platform family are available at:</p>
